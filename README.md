# Awesome-Programming-Languages

In no particular order:
* Lisp (especially Common Lisp)
* Smalltalk
* Self
* Dylan
* Standard ML
* Prolog

Each of these languages have incredible lessons to teach, but the lessons remain obscure because many programmers are taught the myth that syntactic suger is the biggest difference between *all* languages (above and beyond compiled vs interepreted, of course).
